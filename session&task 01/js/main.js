// 1- Calculate the sum of two numbers and print the result

// 2- Calculate the remainder when 15 is divided by 4

// 3- Multiply two numbers and print the result
let product = 7 * 6;

// 4- if "10" (String) is equal to 10 (Number)
console.log('"10" == 10:', "10" == 10);

// 5- Condition checks with isStudent and age
